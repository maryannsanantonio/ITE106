My Calculator class is a solid implementation of a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) 
using JFrame and Swing. It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Additionally, it maintains a history of operations that is saved to and read from a file. 
Below are a few observations, recommendations, and minor improvements:

Key Observations:
1. History Panel: The history of calculations is displayed in a JTextArea on the left side of the window. It records every calculation performed, and the history is saved to a file (calculator_history.txt).

2. Basic Operations: It supports basic arithmetic operations like +, -, *, /, and provides the ability to clear inputs with the C button.

3. Error Handling: You handle division by zero and display an error message in the text field, which is a good approach.

4. History Update: Every time a calculation is performed, the history is updated both in the GUI and in the text file.
